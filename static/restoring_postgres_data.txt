The *.bin files in this archive contain the raw data that can be restored to PostgreSQL (v9.5+).

The process of restoring is as follows:
    1. Run PGAdmin application
    2. Create a database (e.g., easytrack_db)
    3. Open query tool
    4. Create a schema called "data" by running the following sql script :
            create schema "data"
    5. Create a table for restoring the data you want with the following script:
            create table "data"."[YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID_HERE]-[PARTICIPANT_ID_HERE]"
            (
                "id" serial primary key,
                "timestamp" bigint,
                "value" bytea not null,
                "data_source_id" integer,
                unique ("timestamp", "data_source_id")
            );
    6. Restore the data of a participant from a file with the following script :
            copy "data"."[YOUR_CAMPAIGN_ID_HERE]-[YOUR_PARTICIPANT_ID_HERE]"("id", "timestamp", "value", "data_source_id") from [DOWNLOADED_FILE_PATH_HERE] with binary;
    7. Done, enjoy! =)
